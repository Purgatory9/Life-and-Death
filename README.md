# Life and Death

Welcome to the Game of LIFE and DEATH.  A Social experiment beginning with LIFE that requires your participation where the motherlode of ETH is waiting as a reward to holders of DEATH.  

In the beginning, there were 1,000  LIFE. These will be sold on a first come, first serve basis. Remaining tokens not used in the presale are burned. The sale will be via a simple smart contract or manual via admin. At the end of the sale we will split the life proportionally among those who sent in ETH. 

After the sale has been filled, a Liquidity Pool will be created on Uniswap with 1 LIFE and equivalent ETH balance. This will be the extent of Admins participation in this pool. It will be up to the players to fill the LP to get the UNIV2 token which will be required to play.

The UNIV2 Liquidity POOL token from the ETH/LIFE Pool can then be placed into a farm that will yield DEATH over the course of 3 days.

However, what happens next is interesting as the entire motherlode of ETH collected in the Presale is placed in a POOL with DEATH  and is there for the taking for anybody that can acquire DEATH from the Yield farm.  

Additionally, a LIFE/DEATH token pair will be established. There are many ways to play the Game of Life & Death.

Oh, and death is just the beginning.
